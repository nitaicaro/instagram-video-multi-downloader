## Prerequisits
You'll need [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup)

## How to use, for now

1. Create a text file called "example.txt" and paste your links, onr per line. For example:
'''
https://www.instagram.com/p/CFwXdGMDnZh/

https://www.instagram.com/p/CFP6KfslmNR/
'''

Make sure the text file is in the same directory with [downloader.py](https://github.com/nitaicaro/instagram-video-multi-downloader/blob/master/downloader.py)

2. CD to the project directory and run 
>py downloader.py

The script will create a folder with all the downloaded videos.
